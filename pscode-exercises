// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

have a box for numerical input
check if numerical value is divisible by 2
else it will asign the numerical value odd
print on screen that the numerical value is either even or odd

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.
have a box asking for 5 individual numbers
store numberical value of 5 numbers
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
add all numerical values together and divide the total by the amount of numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
if numerical value is < the first number then minimum if > maximum, list top to bottom
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are
Print on screen numerical value and "Average of numbers listed"
Print on screen numerical value and "minimum of numbers listed" and "maximum of numbers listed"
